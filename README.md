This project focuses on healthcare data analysis using Python. It explores patient-level information to uncover health patterns, analyze treatment outcomes, and build predictive insights that can support hospitals, clinicians, and healthcare administrators.

The notebook includes:

Loading and exploring healthcare datasets

Data cleaning, handling missing values, and standardizing fields

Exploratory data analysis (AGE, BP, SUGAR, CHOLESTEROL, DIAGNOSIS patterns etc.)

Identifying correlations between symptoms, conditions, and outcomes

Building and evaluating predictive models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Interpreting results to understand risk factors, patient segmentation, and disease prediction

This project serves as an introductory template for anyone working on healthcare analytics, medical data modeling, or clinical decision support using machine learning.
